## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a yearly advent calendar of
programming puzzles created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl). Every day of
December until the end of the event features a two-part puzzle, with the second
part unlocking after the first is completed. This website compiles my own
solutions and explanations for each puzzle I've solved.

I've been solving Advent of Code with Python since 2023 and sharing my
solution explanations since 2024. I try -- hopefully sometimes successfully --
to write clear code that's easy to explain, as I find it helps make my code
easier to understand and iterate upon.

I like Advent of Code. Not only does it give me a chance to practice coding and
problem solving, but it also helps me learn new things about Python specifically
and computer science in general.

## Background Knowledge

My explanations assume that you know at least a little bit about programming.
The more you know, however, the more you'll likely get out of them.

You're expected to know the very basics of Python at bare minimum, but I will
also use and explain some intermediate and advanced features of Python. And
while my explanations will be Python-specific, the ideas involved _should_ be
applicable to any programming language you may know.

Each solution's explanation assumes that you are familiar with the previous
solutions that year; I would recommend reading each year's solutions in order,
to not miss anything important.

## Goals

When writing my solutions, I try to ensure that they:

- Apply to _everyone's_ inputs, without hardcoding any data specific to my own
input.
- Take a reasonable amount of time to run (i.e. usually 15 seconds or ~less~
fewer).
- Require only the Python standard library (as a personal preference).
- Use my own ideas, if I can solve the puzzle well by myself.
- Adapt some _other_ approach that I can understand and explain, if I get stuck
on my own.
- Follow [The Zen of Python](https://pep20.org), if possible.

The end result may not be the absolute best code in the world, but at least it's
_mine_, and it's the best I can make it. That's what counts.

## Inspiration

During Advent of Code 2024, I made one blog post for each day's puzzle, for a
total of 25. For comparison, my blog only had _10 posts_ beforehand. So even
though I still wanted a public place to put my solutions, I didn't want them to
clutter my blog.

The thing that pushed me to specifically create this website was
[David Brownman's Advent of Code blog](https://advent-of-code.xavd.id), where
he's been putting his own Python solutions since 2020. He presents his solutions
very effectively, his [solution template](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code-python-template)
(which I use a modified form of) is easy to use, and the [Expressive Code](https://expressive-code.com)
engine he uses in his writeups makes his code blocks look _sweet_!

I used a modified form of his blog's code as a basis for this one -- mainly
because I wanted the same style of code blocks, and Expressive Code doesn't work
with [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) yet. This site wouldn't be possible
without his blog, so I'd recommend checking it out!
